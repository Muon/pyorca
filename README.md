# pyorca

pyorca is a Python implementation of the [ORCA](http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/ORCA/)
local collision avoidance algorithm, made from scratch.

pyorca.py and halfplaneintersect.py contain copious amounts of comments and
notes regarding the implementations of their respective algorithms.

test.py contains a simple pygame-powered demo I used to test my implementation. 


## Todo

* Implement the 3D LP fallback described in the paper.
